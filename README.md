# Advent of Code 2021

My participation to the Advent of Code 2021, in C++.

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER** ⚠️ \
The main goal is resolution time. This is not intended to be the most beautiful code nor the most efficient. \
It's just something that _works_ and developped with _performance in mind_ (but not as a primary concern).


## Usage

### Prerequisites

- bash
- clang (or any C++ compiler if you edit the `CXX` variable in `run.sh`)

### Run a problem

    ./run.sh <problem>/<part>

Example:

    ./run.sh 05_hydrothermal_venture/part2
